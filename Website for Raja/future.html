            <h3>Cars, Cars and Cars</h3>
            <p>A technological tsunami has been upturning the automotive industry over the last decade. Traditional patterns have been exploding as the digital revolution leads to reinventing all the hardware and software architecture on vehicles. It may well be that in a few years’ time, a car will look nothing like it does today.</p>
            <p>In the opinion of Pascal Brier, Altran Group Executive Vice-President and responsible for innovation, it is disruptive technology. The car of the future is well and truly on its way! Here are its main features.</p>
            <h3>The electric car</h3>
            <p>Electric was the first phenomenon to transform cars. When it was first introduced, experts envisaged a specific use – for public transport for example. Beating the predictions, electric cars are slowly emerging as a must-have in all the market segments. It now has numerous technological advantages and its alleged historical weaknesses, such as autonomy (600 km for the latest Tesla for example) or road performance, no longer apply.</p>
            <p>This trend has been greatly reinforced by environmental obligations to reduce particle and greenhouse gas emissions. In the years ahead, increasingly powerful hybrid or electric engines will gradually replace the traditional internal combustion engine.</p>
